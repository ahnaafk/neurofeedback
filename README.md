# neurofeedback

NOTE: write_to_csv and write_to_graph are meant to be proof of concepts ONLY. The programs don't correctly plot data,
I just wanted to show that it's possible to stream data to a CSV and plot it that way.

This is a simple neurofeedback project with a live EEG stream in Brainflow-Python that can be easily edited. 

I used the Brainflow ML model to determine concentration and relaxation levels for this project.
